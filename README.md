# WoolyTrading

## Project Goal
WoolyTrading is a portfolio project focused on building a modern web application for selling TCG cards, boosters, and related products.

The primary goal of this project is **learning and demonstrating web development skills**, with an emphasis on clean architecture, maintainable code, and realistic junior-level solutions.  
Feature completeness is intentionally not the main priority.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET)
- Database: Planned (Entity Framework Core will be used)
- Architecture: Client–Server (REST)

## Scope (Phase 1 – Foundation)
- Project setup and base architecture
- Basic domain modeling (e.g. products, categories)
- Initial API structure
- Angular application setup and API communication

Advanced features such as authentication, orders, or payments are **explicitly postponed** to later phases.

## Setup
Coming soon.

## Project Status
**Phase 1 – Foundation (in progress)**  
Focus on establishing a clean and understandable technical base for future development.
